  <p>This year I entered the IT world. It was a difficult but very satisfying decision and today I am grateful and surprised with the progress and skills I acquired.

  <p>Although I have more affinity for the Front-End, I feel very comfortable working in the Back-End so my goal is to continue developing in both areas.
